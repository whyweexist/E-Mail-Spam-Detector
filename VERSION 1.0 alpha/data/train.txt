fw energy leader consulting generation evaluator ege vince this is the gentleman that wants to meet with you on the number th original message from steve mitnick enron mailto imceanotes number steve number mitnick number number number csmitnick number earthlink number enet number e number enron enron com sent monday may number number number number am to crenshaw shirley cc vkamins enron com subject energy leader consulting generation evaluator ege shirley as requested herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski the presentation on the ege tool s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday may number might i request it be set for late afternoon as my other appointments are the next day and as vince will recall i was co leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly and developer of the ramp up real time number check and electric strategy tools presently i am ceo of energy leader consulting elc background the u s power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively utilities who still control most power plants endeavor to adopt the entrants methods yet inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling many utilities notwithstanding the industry wide trend towards profit maximization cling to ingrained routines inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale a utility may operate a relatively small system fewer than a dozen plants a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers playing the wholesale market at the margin for a variety of reasons utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units let alone shut down any even temporarily or seasonally economically inefficient units continue to be committed week after week and run in the half load range ege objectives ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines taking into account transmission and reliability factors the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant i an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long term wholesale power transaction with a utility or to price wholesale power more aggressively to take market share from the utility i e compel changes in unit commitment habits ii an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition iii a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized specific ege concepts ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities it produces indicative statistics such as a the frequency distribution of starts per week b the frequency distribution of starts by day number minute segment during the week c the frequency distribution of load level d the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start e average heat rate and approximate fully allocated cost in the half load range f average ramp rate from the half load range g the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours and h forced off maintenance outage rate where indicated indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month year in some cases by temperature range they can be by regional wholesale prices as well ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data ege is now updated for the number th quarter number through december number number ege lst quarter number through march number number will be available approximately june number number ege also compares and ranks generating units commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility as well as other regional generators some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half load level for lengthy time periods without an apparent reliability basis splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units other ege supporting data i planned maintenance schedule where indicated j actual maximum generating capacity k actual minimum generating capacity actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government reported values l average heat rate in the full load range and m average heat rate in the three quarter load range with respect to a generating units average heat rate in the half load three quarter load and full load ranges it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities and changes in recent years in these parameters the real world example of allegheny energy allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege in the number th quarter number for instance one high cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning number times and committed for the whole day in all but two cases arguably there are power products that could substitute for this routine in part at least at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy another high cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn nine times and committed for most of the coming week at another plant two high cost units were operated too often in the expensive half load range some number hours and three quarter load range another number to number hours they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels again there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy offering of energy leader consulting elc ege is a procedure not a software package or data base elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities elc transfers its knowledge about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight forward four step process number enron would select one to three target utilities number elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities number employing this real world analysis as a pedagogic tool elc in a one day seminar with enron personnel would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future without the assistance of elc number optionally elc would provide ege supporting data quarterly to enron the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program virtually all fossil fuel units parameters that are incorporated and the data set format will be specified upon request custom modifications will be considered steven a mitnick chief executive officer energy leader consulting number number st street nw washington dc number number number

i am a staff of private banking services at the bank of china boc i am contacting you concerning our customer and an investment placed under our banks management number years ago i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you in number the subject matter ref bbbocbank number came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking services department he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of number million united states dollars which he wished to have us turn over invest on his behalf i was the officer assigned to his case i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the defacto chief operations officer of the private banking services department especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings the favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on number traditional stocks and bond managers and number managers of alternative investments based on my advice we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over number million united states dollars this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments in mid number he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in europe he directed that i liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm i informed him that the bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process the bank would have to make a number deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incident of number i contacted my affiliate in and had the funds available i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and wellconnected organizations in line with instructions the money was deposited he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week this was the last communication we had this transpired around number th october number in january this year we got a call from the security firm informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit and i could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit i made futile efforts to locate him i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of the bank of china four days later information started to trickle in apparently he was dead a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in canne south of france we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate if you are familiar with private banking affairs those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes in his biodata form he listed no next of kin in the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said rarely do they nominate next of kin private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care in this case he died intestate in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem the investigation did not ever yield any result my official capacity dictates that i am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation this leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit according to practice the firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to boc failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to boc this will result in the money entering the boc accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking services department this will not happen if i have my way what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose there is us number deposited i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as boc is concerned the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when i sent the funds to the firm all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward this is the situation this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family they have investigated for months and have found no family the investigation has come to an end my proposal i am prepared to place you in a position to give instruction for the release of the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation upon receipt of the deposit i am prepared to share the money with you in half that is i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you we share the proceeds number i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer i will then officially communicate with the firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you with these two things all is done the alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm we can finetune this based on our interactions i am aware of the consequences of this proposal i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive if my offer is of no appeal to you delete this message and forget i ever contacted you do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector i am not a criminal and what i do i do not find against good conscience this may be hard for you to understand but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime i cannot let this chance pass me by for once i find myself in total control of my destiny these chances wont pass me by i ask that you do not destroy my chance if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank i am the only one who knows of this situation good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life lets share the blessing if you find yourself able to work with me contact me through this same email account if you give me positive signals i will initiate this process towards a conclusion i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels i will deny knowing you and about this project i repeat i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account contact me only through this email

kulatilaka enron com sent thursday march number number number number pm to mack iris cc lin martin subject re possible visit to enron by professor nalin kulatilaka of boston university hi iris i have two different hats to wear in talking to enron one is as a financial economist the other as the director of the newly formed global mobility innovation initiative gmii this is the research project funded by lucent involving bu lbs and insead to study various aspects of the mobile internet read number g on the former i am working with a couple of ph d students in understanding a details of how having physical supply inventory can be used by a market maker this is a problem that has been studies in the context of specialists inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in the way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth i think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the ground b how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another all of the incomplete contracting asymmetric information and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models but they are real in practice my impression is enron s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining c how enron manages the various books that involve physicals financials credit etc this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore include non linear risk profiles the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years on the gmii front i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber i am working with several people at lucent on this issue i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call clearly having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me as for schedules the first number weeks of april are horrible april

how are you today and business in your country i am mrxiao gang bank managerbank of overseas chinese north shyn lin district taipei taiwan i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you i know you would be wondering why i am writing you with a request such as this but i only urge you to read on in november number a british oil consultantcontractor with the chinese solid minerals corporation mr mark kogan made a fixed deposit of the sum of us number ten million united states dollars which accumulated to the sum of us number twenty million one hundred and sixty thousand one hundred and seventy six united states dollars for twelve calendar months in my branch upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address in america and britain but got no reply after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the chinese solid minerals corporation that mrmark kogan died alongside his wife from an airplane crash the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate if you are familiar with private banking affairs those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes in his biodata form he listed no next of kin in the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said rarely do they nominate next of kin private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care in this case mr mark kogan died interstate in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem this sum of us number has since been sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year no one will ever come forward to claim it according to the laws of republic of china at the expiration of number five years the money will revert to the ownership of the chinese government if nobody applies to claim the funds what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational the world of banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose there is us number deposited in my bank i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased which i shall provide you with is presented i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as bank of overseas chinese is concerned the banks management has no single idea of what number s the history or nature of the deposit they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward this is the situation this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man number s family they have investigated for months and have found no family the investigation has come to an end consequently my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to mr mark kogan so that the fruits of this old mans labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials acting in this capacity really is simple all you have to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin we shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the necessary authentication approval and a letter of probateadministration in your favour for the transfer to be done a bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiarynext of kin the money will be paid into your account for us to share number i am aware of the consequences of this proposal i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive if my offer is of no appeal to you delete this message and forget i ever contacted you do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector i am not a criminal and what i do i do not find against good conscience this may be hard for you to understand but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime i cannot let this chance pass me by for once i find myself in total control of my destiny this is my chance and i wont let it pass me by i ask that you do not destroy my chance if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me i am a family man and this

number reduction in road accidents august number dear sir madam in case you have received this mail earlier kindly ignore this mail it may have been re sent to you by mistake ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody we have devised a set of systems which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than seventy five percent we have already filed and are in process of filing further multiple and appropriate disclosure documents provisional patent applications at the united states patent trademarks office uspto and also applications under the patent co operation treaty at world intellectual property organization wipo at geneva there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative moreover we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing minimizing human suffering to a very large extent there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings statistics advantages options economics we are looking for the followings number business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds one person mildly injured every three seconds c current yearly automobile sales worldwide more than number billion us d number of automobiles worldwide more than number billion pieces e daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide more than number billion us per day number of the worldwide gross national product of more than number billion us more than number us per year more than number billion us per day theadvantages of the technology developed by us a the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto insurance this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles accordingly the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction additionally because of saving of lives the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially b as per the who studies and projections road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today it is projected by who that by the year number they will occupy the number three positions next only to heart disease and depression by introduction of this technology we are sure that this will not happen on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death in the year number at all c this technology will therefore make all vehicles cheaper and safer not only will the cost be reduced safety which is priceless in itself will also be greatly enhanced as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted the life of the patent will be number years even at the current levels with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death there is a daily loss of two billion us even at the present level over a period of twenty years without any interest and without any compounding this loss works out to be number billion us x number days x number years number number billion us d our technology will ensure that at least seventy five percent of the above losses are prevented such figure works out to be more that number number billion us it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level as per the future projections the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase hence the figure is likely to be increase very substantially in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further e at the current levels more than number number million persons are dying every year due to road accidents even at the current rates more than number million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years i e life of the patent when granted besides at the current levels number number million people are injured every year in the next twenty years the number of people injured due to road accident will therefore be more than half a billion f if we add to that the personal physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings are all unmeasurable in quantities presently known to human kind g considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind h the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that in the very near future the use of this technology will become unavoidable it should and will become mandatory by law to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future i as described hereinabove this technology and its utility are incomparable outthought of and unheard of till date it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures in future it can and will be applied to other mode of transport like aircrafts and trains also among other things we have the following options available to us options available to us a outright sale a immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration b further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications before taking steps as outlined in a the process b will obviously increase the realization in terms of price b licencing options i new vehicles granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles individually or collectively all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis ii conversion of existing vehicles to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than number billion vehicles all over the world c combined options a collaborative arrangement with some private and or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre decided sharing partnership arrangement the economics of the project will be as follows number in case any all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs the cost escalation may not be more than number to number and the safety and the protection will be ten times more than the price escalation hence drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation number in case the existing vehicles are modified the cost involved will be approximately number to number of the value of the vehicle but partial modifications at a lower cost which will give partial protection may also be carried out as a thumb rule the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided number in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective number there are more than number billion motor vehicles in the world at present besides there are an unspecified number of non motorized ehicles number almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from number among the motorised vehicles the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out but over all some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency number even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of number us per vehicle the conversion industry works out to be worth number number number billion us number realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date number as pointed hereinabove the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to in the range of number number number billion us per year over the next three years number alternatively considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition for such conversion licenses can be granted on line on receipt of on line payments in that case different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle number in case licensing is done the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end user

you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally i am the first daughter of the most popular black farmer in zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country i got your contact through network online hence i decided to write you before the death of my father he took me to johannesburg to deposit the sum of us number million thirty million united states dollars in one of the security company as he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the security company this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr robert mugabe introduced a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society in fact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father was one of the victims it is against this background that i and my family fled zimbabwe to south africa for fear of our lives after which i traveled to the netherlands and i am currently staying in the netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my fathers money to a more reliable foreign account since the law of europe prohibits a refugee asylum seeker to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of european union as the eldest child of my father i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got the south african government seems to be playing along with them i am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for fear of going through difficulty in future both countries have similar political history i am seeking for a partner who i have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands i must let you know that this transaction is risk free if you accept to assist me and my family all i want you to do for me is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment funds from their affiliate office here in the netherlands as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the netherlands from south africa but before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment i have two options for you firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country whichever the option you want feel free to notify me i have also mapped out number of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction if you do not prefer a partnership i am willing to give you number of the money while the remaining number will be for my investment in any of the country of your choice while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction i await your immediate reply and god bless	FRAUD

urgent contact from the desk of dr tom eke e mail dr tomeke spinfinder com lagos nigeria attn request for urgent business relationship it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter first i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried considering the fact that we have not met each other before but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the e mail which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year number however let me start by introducing myself properly to you i am dr tom eke a director general in the department of petroleum resources d p r and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel our duties include evaluation vetting approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d p r e t c in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows in the second quarter of number this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us number million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over inflate the total contract sum from us number million to us number million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us number miilion amongst ourselves the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year number approved the sum of us number million for us as the contract sum and the sum of us number million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done but since the companies are entiltled to us number million dollars only we are now left with us number million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel we cannot do this by ourselves as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau civil service laws from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now i have therefore been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us number million hence we are writing you this letter my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain number of the total amount us number million while number will be for us officials and the remaining number will be used in offsetting all debts expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer needless to say the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous in return we demand your complete honesty and trust you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below a our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody or any form of blackmail d that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of number from the total amount please note that this transaction is number legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction there is no cause for alarm i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty i will explain more to you when i have heard from you please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e mail address i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction i will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me

update reimbursement of individually billed items the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors with the higher volume we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable at times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone in these cases we return the invoice to the vendor if the employee is designated we try to track him her down and forward the invoice the high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this increasingly challenging either way we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research we request that employees who have pagers cell phones and other individually billed items such as licenses subscriptions etc pay for them by personal check or charge card if applicable  payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice and request reimbursement through employee expense reports by submitting these charges on your expense report you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices the number of checks generated by treasury the number of vendors in our database and the turnaround time for payment of invoices incidentally accounts payable is currently installing a corporate wide web based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has used for the past year this will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement we  d like to make this effective immediately if you have any questions or suggestions please contact the accounts payable department	NORMAL

article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment over the next few days as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media in newspapers online and on television it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games we also came across some staggering statistics merrill lynch for example has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full number of global economic activity

the online gaming industry in other words appears to be booming and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest we decided to find out who the key players were in the business after speaking with a number of industry insiders the trail led us to an emerging publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc ggts after a close look at ggts we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months although ggts is a new company it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno com website which if youre marketing keno is as good as it gets keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games including poker and sports book betting once it offers these popular games and given that it already has keno com online the company could bring in great revenues attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price after a successful north american launch gaming transactions inc gtts has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia this initiative looks like a wise business decision many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by number so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach what does

cera monthly oil briefing cera alert december number number title cera monthly oil briefing fundamentals update e mail category cera monthly briefing cera knowledge area world oil in the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colder than normal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key us market that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market furthermore the potential for weakness in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in number the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals if the cutoff lasts through december the effect will be pronounced it would turn a projected fourth quarter number stockbuild of number number million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of number number mbd we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions and exports may again cease at some point such a development would have a price supportive effect cera s price outlook for number remains the same as that in the world oil watch released in late november assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of iraqi production the projected average for first quarter number is number per barrel for wti however this outlook is based on opec s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter a failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of number wti for the first quarter of number with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first the downward pressure results from the prospect of a larger than usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about number number mbd with a cut in opec output iraq in a twilight zone as anticipated iraq ceased exporting oil under the un controlled oil for food program as of december number in protest over the rejection by the security council s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule iraq s pricing was judged by the un overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about number cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that iraq was seeking from buyers although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues iraq partially resumed exporting on december number since then about number mbd has been exported from the mina al bakr terminal in the persian gulf prior to the shutdown iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of number number mbd for november as compared with number number mbd for the third quarter exports for november were about number number mbd from mina al bakr and about number number mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean exports from ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about number number mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market iraq s semi shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues in the midst of this dispute the un security council approved phase nine of the oil for food program at the last minute on december number it became effective on december number and has been accepted by iraq as of decemberl number iraq s revised export price for ceyhan proposed for the remainder of december has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee additionally the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow account would be a violation of un sanctions buyers of iraqi oil from mina al bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to iraq how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system the distinction that iraq has made between mina al bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al bakr by loading two cargoes for the india oil company iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil as currently structured the deal would violate un sanctions but india is seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic hardship the exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead iraq to cease exports from mina al bakr again there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security council to end all restraints consequently the iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook iraq s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take office secretary of state designate colin powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policy oriented think tank in washington a consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining un control over iraq s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote demand trends record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel back up have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand so far in december us distillate demand is running at a record high december level of number number mbd however only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuel switching from gas to distillate cera estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of number number to number number mbd in cera s view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer a portion of the us secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing back up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil supply trends non opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up number number mbd over a year earlier at number number mbd recent events include a shortfall in mexican production curtailed in october by about number number bd owing to the effects of hurricane keith mexico s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be number number mbd about number percent of mexican liquids capacity norway s output increased number number bd from october to november as maintenance season ended norway s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be number number mbd growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached number number mbd in november after remaining fairly steady at about number number mbd from july though october fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average number number mbd number number mbd greater than in the fourth quarter number cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged number number mbd in november down number number mbd from the october level the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced iraqi output for the first number days of december to roughly number number mbd iraq resumed exports of about number mbd on december number which raised production to number number mbd assuming no change in iraq s current production stance iraqi production would average number number mbd for december on a quarterly basis the decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth quarter of number number mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of number number mbd into a stockdraw of number number mbd these production estimates include number number mbd of crude oil exports to syria that began on november number without un authorization and are continuing oil stocks us crude oil inventories doe data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of number million barrels in september and reached number million barrels in mid december see figure number since prices weakened in late november crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september and the ranges seen in october to levels from number number million barrels primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year earlier levels at number million barrels they are number million barrels or number percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up number number million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the united states in november stocks rose nearly number million barrels to number million barrels at this level they are below the highs of number but well above the low levels of early number see figure

folks attached is a conservative and fairly rough estimate of the size of the petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged drought in southern texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and possible curtailed production the total annual revenue generated by these assets is no less than number b and could be substantially higher as the estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial complexes from houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to experience such a drought induced interruption the only facilties identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers brazos colorado navidad guadalupe and nueces please let me know if you have any questions comments as we work to determine whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable thanks charlie	NORMAL

i am bob kambili bank manager of first national bank south africa pty south africawwwfnbcoza and for reasons which will become obvious to you as read on i obtained your address particulars from an internet address listing please exercise some patience and read through my message you can reach me immediately on my private email address henryfnbsamailcom i have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you on june number th number a gold consultantcontractor with the south african national gold corporation mr ahmed youseff mustafa a national of iraq made a numbered time fixed deposit for number calendar months value usd number fifty two milion dollas in my branch on maturity we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply after a month we sent a reminder and finally his contract employers the south african national gold corporation wrote to inform us that mr a y mustafa died from an automobile accident that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the iraqi embassy were fruitless at first i was surprised that i did not receive much official cooperation in my inquiries in order to trace his kin in iraq and inform them about mr mustafas deposit of usd number m plus accrued interest i therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr mustafa had actively opposed the government of president saddam hussein of iraq and was consequently driven into exile being an minning experthe subsequently obtained a job with the south africa gold coporation and settled in south africa thereafter he walked into my office to make the aforementioned deposit of usd number m he did not declare any kin in his application paperwork contrary to laid down procedures and when i asked him he informed me that he wished it so i accepted his application because banks are conservative and will always honour a customers wishes especially high networth customers no one knows the source of his money because apparently the time frame of his employment with the asgc does indeed preclude such a large amount of money it can be assumed that he brought his money over from iraq but that is open to speculation however the point is that his employers are not aware of this money and therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will ever come forward to claim this money this money total usd number m inclusive of accrued interests is still sitting in my bank in the dormant account portfolio no one will ever come forward to claim it now and according to south african law after number years the money will automatically revert to the federal government treasury if the account owner is a foreigner is certified dead and there is no valid claim this indeed is the situation my proposal therefore is that i am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to mr mustafa it is not necessary to be a blood relation to mr mustafa nor have the same name it is not also necessary to come from the same country i have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin and therefore also by this means transfer this money total usd number m abroad for us to share the method of achieving the objective of transferring this money abroad in a completely legal and proper way is simple i intend to use a n attorney representing you as beneficiary to execute a series of affidavits in support of your claim these will be approved the money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the money as money laundering also the paperwork will include proper certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources in short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk i will have to process the initial paperwork to obtain approval from the probate registry ministry of justice to obtain the letter of administration empowering you as sole trusteeexecutor to the estate of mr mustafa if you therefore agree to be the official beneficiary then please note that you will not be required to sign any money transfer documents my attorney will do all that you will not be required to come to south africa only the following is required from you number send to me immediately a bank account a bank account with zero credit balance is ok number complete name and address of the bank number bank account number number name of account holderbeneficiary number your address phone and fax number a brief background information on you cv once you send me the requested information as above i will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about number working days the money total usd number m will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of number for me and number for you this transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problems if you agree to assist me by sending me the above

greetings i am mr dan patrick a staff in barclays bank here in united kingdom however i got your contact through the international web directory recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usd number number fourteen million dollars only that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash during our investigation and auditing in this bank my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to mohamed kamal yasser who died along with his wife and his two sons and the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill it is only an outsider from the bank that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund in order to avert this negative development i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased mohamed kamal yasser please go through the website below to confirm this story wwwcnncomus number egyptair number listindexhtml we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants we can not do it on our own or with close friends because that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank ac immediately to receive this fund even an empty account can also serve for this purpose on smooth conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to number as gratification for your assisting us while number will be set aside to take care of expenses on our both sides that may arise during the time of transfer and also for telephone bills and the remaining number will be for me and my partners what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin i have in my possession all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation please bear in mind that this proposal is number risk free further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish	FRAUD

alliance info alert ferc reporting attached is a summary of recent ferc activities pdf file and the weekly alliance express the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings in a brief meeting yesterday ferc approved a final rule adopting section number merger filing requirements generally as proposed and extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be determined to be workably competitive at the same time ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution next steps and deadlines for resolution implementation additional details are provided below ferc updates streamlines merger filing process ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting requirements for mergers however comm hebert did so with reservations as discussed below commission staff stated that the order closely follows the notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued but adds more detail and more certainty to the industry staff stated that the order is improved over the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products according to ferc the draft order revises the commission s filing requirements to reflect existing merger policy based on ferc s number merger policy guidelines provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market analyses the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with potential horizontal competitive concerns in addition the rule establishes informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise competitive concerns and reduces the industry s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing requirements the rule will take effect number days after its publication in the federal register commissioner reaction comm hebert expressed reservations that although he was voting for the rule ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission ftc market concentration analyses and that ferc should follow the lead of anti trust enforcement officials who could also analyze mergers faster and more confidentially he also stated that ferc should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them not before and that there should be a definite time frame for review hebert did mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission assets would be exempt that ancillary services would be considered as a separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative market analysis comm breathitt supported the final rule stating that it should expedite the approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the fact that older irrelevant requirements have been dropped she indicated that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting the public interest by stating that the process will be efficient yet sufficient the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail competition and one of her main concerns confidentiality comm massey fully supported the final rule emphasizing that it would improve response time lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict commission actions like commissioner breathitt massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high massey also stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc s concerns such as future mergers when they occur in succession retail competition mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and analysis of ancillary services in sum he averred that the order will provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was a very important rule in response to comm hebert chairman hoecker said that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc s report before issuing their own that the anti trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc s expertise when reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries there is a major positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work he noted because the rtos enlarge the size of the subject market he indicated rtos will help to preserve competition therefore more and larger rtos should allow for more mergers he said the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that joining an rto is a requirement for a merger but that it would certainly be viewed favorably nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably competitive in a number number decision with comm hebert dissenting ferc extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be workably competitive at the same time ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution next steps and deadlines for resolution implementation in so doing ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso s september number and number number compliance filing submitted pursuant to its may number number order imposing a temporary bid cap through october number the iso s efforts to correct market flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had not yet satisfied the commission s directives ferc concluded ferc found that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas overall the iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso s non spinning reserve market by april number as the iso requested commissioner reaction comms hoecker massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an imperfect solution yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the iso s market comm hebert faulted the commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack of the iso s progress but contended that significant outstanding issues must be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted in other action ferc accepted nyiso s and nepool s proposed emergency energy

you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally i am gabriel kali the first son of gadik kali one of the most popular black farmers in zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country i got your contact through network online hence decided to write you before the death of my father he had taken me to johannesburg to deposit the sum of us number million fifteen million five hundred thousand united states dollars in one of the private security company as he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr robert mugabe introduced a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society in fact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father was one of the victims it is against this background that my family and i fled zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the nigeria where we are seeking political asylum and however have decided to transfer my fathers money to a more reliable foreign account since the law of this country prohibits a refugee asylum seeker to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone as the eldest son of my father i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got the south african government seems to be playing along with them i am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of this country for fear of going through the same experience in future both countries h ave similar political history i am seeking for a partner who i have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands if you accept to assist me and my family all i want you to do for me is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment funds from their affiliate office here as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the netherlands from south africa but before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money i intend to use for investment i have two options for you firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country whichever the option you want feel free to notify me i have also mapped out number of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of thi s transaction if you do not prefer a partnership i am willing to give you number of the money while the remaining number will be for my investment in your country contact me with the above email address while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction thanks god bless you	FRAUD

re choosing the riskfree rate dear all i completeley agree with ben that treasuries are the most liquid and reliable benchmarks i also think that fmas have their own advantages and disadvantages however it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using libor as benchmark at least to price anything related to capital markets for example credit default swaps our prices will always be different from that on capital markets if we use benchmarks different from the market as a half way solution we can have different benchmarks for example use anything that we decide is closest to risk free to value products significantly different from that priced on capital markets and libor for everything priced on capital markets we can adjust by manipulating other coefficients event liquidity recovery for our purposes but it looks like benchmark should be libor to avoid negative default probabilites for highly rated reference entities we can add cost fo repo and haircuts as all bankers do let us continue our discussion on this slava benjamin parsons number number number number number to bryan seyfried lon ect ect martin mcdermott lon ect ect viacheslav danilov lon ect ect stuart ffoulkes lon ect ect eklavya sareen lon ect ect tomas valnek lon ect ect john metzler lon ect ect simon brooks lon ect ect konstantin malinovski lon ect ect cc vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect steven leppard lon ect ect jitendra patel lon ect ect william s bradford hou ect ect harry arora hou ect ect subject choosing the riskfree rate dear all following on from the discussions had with vince et al a few weeks ago regarding the problems inherent in using treasuries as our benchmark riskfree curve i ve written the attached short document my preliminary conclusions are as follows recent turmoil in the treasury market mostly hit number and number year bonds treasuries are still the most liquid curve and that used by banks for benchmarking risky debt there is a considerable a liquidity scarcity premium inherent within the corporate treasury spread which we are not taking into account more accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy prices based on treasuries which are consistent with the market all further comments are welcome of course regards ben	NORMAL

it ll work just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be interested abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying behavior in the world number million us households number billion purchases along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer response to various offers at the household level given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to whatever the offer is improving the efficiency of mailings and other promotional campaigns so there is an efficiency angle see because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchases our results tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic based models so far the the response from utilities and new entrants i ve been talking to so far has been quite positive and we have some tests of our data underway but we re interested in talking to as many players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet utility needs i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested but i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the number

ees operational risk per our conversation here is the model that i have for simon the notes that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking for volume numbers the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers briefly the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and noncredit risk ideally this would be anything that effects npv of the deal however i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that effect the time and amount of the eam volumes even here such a problem set is quite large if you glance at the spreadsheet model you will notice that there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes if we are to do this rigorously then it is necessary to tear apart ees s business model and although such an attempt to do so would be noble the scope of such an excercise may be too large we need a clear definition of ees operational risk briefly from the ees deals that i have looked at two things drive their profit a long term bet that power prices will go down and that we can improve the facility through various enhancements each of these may be gleaned from the spreadsheet as well as the assumptions regarding the funding of the facility improvements and so on number of the savings is assumed to come from power and number from gas the effeciency gain may not be explicitly given if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains then it would be simple in principle to determine a distribution and hence a distribution of eam volumes npv s etc at this time i understand that rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains but my knowledge is quite sketchy jay hachen may have more info if i get a chance i will try to see if i can do a proof of concept excercise but i have a late january deadline on something else another point even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet model ees has chosen to book things differently i do not have a thorough understanding of their it systems but at least in principle if we can do this for the spreadsheet model then we can do it in their it environment data are data are data they may book efficiency gains through improvement type such as gains due to compressors chillers boilers etc if this is indeed the case then we need to have distributions for each type of improvement if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it systems then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system it would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel workbooks it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run simulations and queries but this would probably take me about five or six weeks finally don hawkins does operational audits for enron s physical assets he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets i don t think that he does it for ees but you might want to give him a call anyway kevin k ps the ees lunch meeting has been moved to wednesdays jay hachen will know more	NORMAL

number number mark w south carolina i m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a thermal barrier what the hell do you think foam is if you are saying that anything that can be forced to

double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it icynene is different it doesn t burn alone it doesn t melt it doesn t emit phosgene does it smoke in a fire situation sure so what blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car get real inspectors you want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn t burn as for the vaunted r rating system it is totally bogus the test is designed to make porous insulations appear to perform better than they actually do measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer the test should have been thrown out for the

re stressing correlations hi everybody following up on our discussions on stressing correlations i made a spreadsheet and a dll here is what it does in the input main sheet the user has to specify the size of the correlation matrix the row and column for the element he wants to stress row number and col number in the example the integer number n iter the original correlation matrix in the output see sheet results we see number columns the first column contains possible correlation values from number to number n iter number numbers for the element number number the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the stressed correlation matrix which is the same as the original matrix except the elements number number and number number which take values from number to number thus the user can see which values for the chosen element number number are permitted those for which the smallest eigenvalue is positive marked green in the example the user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is not permitted to this particular element the smallest eigenvalue is negative then the user might have a few options number all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the chosen element has the desired correlation in it but the change in the correlation matrix is the smallest possible in the sense of matrix norm this is my next step to do for this spreadsheet number just one column and the corresponding row of course will change while the rest of the matrix will stay unchanged kevin s suggestion in this case the user have to choose which column and row he prefers to modify in my example column row number or column row number we can discuss this approach with risk control and see how they like it i send you only the spreadsheet with an example now tanya	NORMAL

info you requested kcc thank you for your interest judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in number of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between number and number billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid number more judgments take its place we identified this massive market number years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making number number number to over number number number per year part time associates are earning between number number number and number number number per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of number to number people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over number million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this number million number million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a number margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between number million to over number million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is number interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on number million at number translates to number number number annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or number number number per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for number times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with number million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately number number million dollars number of all of our associates work out of their home number are women and number are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to number to number of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect number to you and number to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for number number number or number number number number you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over number powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically number number to number number of what other firms charge for example we charge number number for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge number number once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep number and send number to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in the course quote s from several of our students thomas in area code number writes us i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course

questions then provide our report to the fundamentals group in the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the avn and mrf to provide a series of choices which could be input into

which might entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that have taken almost a week to get fully established it seems that this office functions on a hot desk system where

re payment instruction for your outstanding claim for succinct introduction i am dr henry salami of the above named section of the federal republic of nigeria frn the presidency has mandated the audit section to handle all foreign contract awarded and commissioned since number till date based on that your file has been forwarded to my office for review and subsequent payment to those contracts that was genuinely awarded and commissioned based on the review carried out on your claim i discovered that the claim you are laying was grossly overinvoiced and inflated to that magnitude by some officials who contacted you to provide an account to receive the fund simply because the code of conduct bureau does not permit civil servants to run or operate foreign account you are presented to receive the fund as the beneficiary i have discovered that at no time did you execute any contract for the federal republic of nigeria that you are contacted by some officials who presented you as the beneficiary just because contract payment falls within their area of jurisdiction their aim is to divert the fund for you all to share mutually i discovered and decided to contact you though you might find it difficult to believe but it is just the hard truth and so much money has been spent in these matter i am contacting you just for one reason that the fund can still be paid if i recommend because my discovery has not be revealled to anyone yet and i dont want to cancel the payment outrightly because it will not go down well with you i want to let you know that the fund can be paid if you are ready to follow my advise and work secretly with me due to the fact that i have interest in the fund i want to benefit from it so let me know what will be my share out of it then i will go ahead and correct the anomalies and your past mistakes for the fund to be paid to you in seven working daysi am writing you with the spirit that you have seen that this is the truth but it will be very difficult to believe as an auditor attached to the presidency i am interested in the fund and i will like us to do the business together then i will write a favourable report about the claim for the immediate release of the fund or i will put up a report that will lead to the total cancellation of the payment i know you have lost much money in lobbying the officials to get the approvals at the precise moment the claim has been processed we are irrevocably mandated to debit the federal government accounti will be expecting your call urgently on my direct no number number number for us to discuss verbally for it might interest you to note that seven working day from the moment you acknowledge the receipt of this mail and agree on my terms will be enough to confirm the fund in your account provided you abide by my rules and also maintain the confidentiality of the transaction to avoid anything that will discredit my reputation i advice you discontinue any further communication with any other person for us to proceed in concrete fashion waiting for your response as a matter of urgency as the number nd payment quarter will come to end shortly do reconfirm your current telephone it is for effective communication revert with utmost urgency thanks	FRAUD

auctions with an incumbent s right of first refusal shelley my colleague clayton vernon who has a background in economics wrote a short summary of arguments against the rofr we are working on the second approach to the problem we try to come up with a numerical estimate of the value of this option the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences he has something of value he never paid for having a numerical estimate of the value of this option could help to argue against it the value of such an option is case specific so we shall rather produce a template you can use for valuation case by case vince kaminski forwarded by vince j kaminski hou ect on number number number number number am clayton vernon enron number number number number number am to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc stinson gibner hou ect ect zlu hou ect ect subject auctions with an incumbent s right of first refusal vince here is an essay on the issue you are discussing the adverse economic impact of rights of first refusal an option to first refuse to match a competitor s offer is a restraint of free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace this economic conclusion is unambiguous if an incumbent has the right to match an offer made by a competitor for an item or service of value then few competitors will invest the time and expense necessary to prepare and submit offers those offers will be lower than they would have been otherwise and the contract will often be awarded to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger in a traditional auction where all bids are sealed and the item up for auction is awarded to the highest bidder we can safely predict the item will be awarded to the bidder who values it the most at a price reflecting the full value of the item up for auction this is the efficient result in a market economy because the financing of the high bid reflects resources freely allocated to the high bidder if the auction has open bids we can again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder albeit at a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the second highest valuation now in a modified auction where an incumbent bidder has the right to match the highest bid and retain the item for himself each competing bidder must justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the following and likely scenario the incumbent does not spend himself for due diligence but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the top bid from a competitor simply put the incumbent with a right of first refusal can be safely predicted to simply match their competitor s bid by rule of thumb but the incumbent s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the valuation of the competitor by the amount of the due diligence and administrative expenses and the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise of his competitors not only in their valuations themselves a nontrivial financial exercise but in any operational details required to be submitted along with the bid furthermore in an esoteric concept known as the winner s curse a bidder realizes that if his bid actually prevails if the incumbent fails to match it he almost certainly overbid given this most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when an incumbent has the right of first refusal and those that submit a bid do not rationally invest the time expense and expertise necessary they may just fire off a low ball bid after all in almost every conceivable state of the world arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose money so the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a below market price despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its most efficient use	NORMAL

wall street s dirty little secret it was the spring of number i was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles each day in the cafeteria i walked from table to table stealing other kids lunch money no i didn t rob them with a gun or a knife i just made them a little deal let me borrow two dollars today i said and i ll bring you five dollars next week the investment was too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes of course when next week rolled around and i couldn t pony up the cash i promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year s lunch money i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid and i didn t even get beat up hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn first of all greed is your number one enemy you re not going to turn number into number in a week so cash out when you re ahead don t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket second never trust an investment adviser of any kind they are looking out for their own money not yours the professionals those stuffy investment counselors and money managers will always tell you that the best time to buy is now according to those guys the longer you keep your money in the market the more money you re going to make ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is never in a sense they are right if you put number number in an index fund right now you ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years but here s the problem do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich hell no you want the money now so you can enjoy it it s hard to make use of your fortune when you re seventy years old in a wheelchair if you could make a million dollars in the next few years what would you do with it where would you travel what kind of car would you buy the

regard to the long run and short run gas models they are both implemented in the same software system neither is a prerequisite for running the other but both operate the same way and the sum of the two consumes approximately the same resources are either individually i plan to have an extended visit in houston beginning one week from today and lasting through the following wednesday intensively tutoring my daughter for her first semester economics finals at rice she certainly should have gotten a better looking tutor that will make it very easy to come by and finalize whatever needs to be

employees on a case study the cost of a weekly project would be number number that would be applied to the purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software this project would allow us to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model internally please let me know more about this option we are primarily interested in a long term natural gas model and the database for north america unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite we don t have resources to spend too much time on it of course a trading desk may be interested in the short term version of the model i shall talk to them about it vince dale m nesbitt on number number number number number number pm to vince j kaminski cc subject marketpoint license agreement john vince i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people thank you very much for setting it up and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people as i mentioned to john i am sending you the license paperwork for marketpoint i have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration as i mentioned the license agreement covers the entire bundled product which includes north american gas short and long term north american electricity short and long term world gas western european gas world oil we are just finishing porting the world oil world gas and western european gas models over from our old now obsolete software system into marketpoint so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months however the gas and electricity models for north america are presently complete and tested that should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business as i understood it you will want the gas modeling capability first and will want to defer decisions on electric or other capability as i mentioned at the meeting we are prepared to offer that for approximately the fully bundled price as you read the license agreement you will see that the software licenses for number number annually the gas data for number number and the electric data for number number marketpoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for the software license plus the data license for a total of number number annually this is just under the fully bundled price i think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting and from marketpoint s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with enron if or when enron ever desires to scale up to another model or model s from the marketpoint portfolio we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement this will allow you to decouple the gas decision from any other decisions you might make i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy scope and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business if you decide to license marketpoint we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model which is the model we suggest you begin with and travel to houston to deliver our number day training seminar our clients are usually very fluent after that number day training seminar thereafter we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed very fluent and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later thanks again and all the best if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send please remind me my

somewhat but remain at a record high level of number number per barrel in the first quarter jet kerosene differentials versus wti rose number number per barrel from the october average reaching a whopping number number per barrel in november in correspondence with the distillate market jet kerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals cera expects jet kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of number number per barrel margins for us gulf coast number sulfur residual fuel dropped by number number per barrel reaching number number per barrel below wti during november despite the recent widening of differentials cera expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months residual fuel differentials are expected to average number number per barrel below wti during the first quarter of next year at the high end of the historical range us demand highlights apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about number number million barrels per day mbd from the october level reaching number number mbd for the four weeks ending december number demand is averaging less than number percent below last year largely because y number k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive averaging number number mbd during the first quarter of number reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at number number mbd for the four weeks ending december number over number percent greater than this time last year this represents a slight increase of about number number million barrels mb from the end october level of number number mb but still a record high level for early december with support from low home heating oil inventories particularly in the northeast distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of number cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months averaging number number mb during the first quarter of next year apparent demand for jet fuel declined by number percent from the october level to reach number number mbd for the four weeks ending december number despite the decline apparent jet fuel demand is over number percent above the year ago level the relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals cera expects the demand for jet fuel to average number number mb during the fourth quarter reported demand for residual fuel dropped to number number mbd for the four weeks ending december number a decline of about number number mbd from the october average and a slight increase over the november level demand for residual fuel is currently number percent greater than last year and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the number number to number number mbd range during the first quarter of number us inventory highlights primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to number number mb increasing almost number mb from the end october value responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to number number days for the four weeks ending december number forward supply is number number percent below last year s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight years although cera still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter however cera is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of october at number number days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december number despite record high apparent demand strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly to number number mb for this period primary stocks are number percent below last year s level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever although stocks are low cera does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter assuming normally cold weather refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirements albeit at a high price jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about number day of coverage to reach number number days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december number this moves jet fuel coverage above the number number to number days supply range that it had been in for the past four months the rise of just under number day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost number days of forward supply from october reaching number number days of forward supply during the four weeks ending december number the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks with demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices cera

appreciated let me know what your thoughts are thanks julie we re getting close preface one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives pricing and risk management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discuss in depth the models and to show how they relate to each other in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models price a wide range of energy derivatives or to build a risk management system which uses a consistent modelling framework we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets see also others who propose consistent models however it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model s we prefer we therefore try and give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into number chapters in chapter number we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used throughout the book in chapter number we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices we look at the well know process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated chapter number written by vince kaminski grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets this chapter builds on the previous one it examines in detail the methods merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter number examples from crude gas and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility chapter number examines forward curves in the energy markets although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the most financial markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets the arbitrage approach the econometric approach and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors chapter number presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well as energy swaptions compound options asian options barrier options lookback options and ladder options chapter number investigates single and multi factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives closed form solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and european option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model chapter number shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter number simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme is developed this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and american style options chapter number describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve the approach results in a multi factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form closed form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options chapter number focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models the general model presented in chapter number is ideally suited to multi factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed chapter number examines the key risk management concept of value at risk var applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products after discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation and monte carlo simulation applying each to the same portfolio of energy options in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables finally in chapter number we review modelling approaches to credit risk we look in detail at two quite different approaches creditmetrics j p morgan number and creditrisk credit suisse financial products number for which detailed information is publicly available together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the tool and the market works the

re dear navroz thanks for getting back to me the reason there has been a dialogue not i should point out with nick but with shan millie is that my work is of quite a large size and needs to find an appropriate home the question is should it go into a compilation book or somehow be published in the magazine i was awaiting some feedback from risk on the best course of action we were hoping to publish a cut down version in the magazine and a full version in risk s upcoming game choices book but i ve heard nothing from your organisation until now and i fear we ve now missed the boat on the game choices book deadline i m attaching the full internal enron document for your reference and i d appreciate your thoughts on how best to put the article in your journal since the subject is highly diagrammatic i m concerned that number words may be too many when coupled with diagrams it is currently only number words but is around number a number pages long if you can give me some guidance on the issue of publishing extensive diagrams as part of the text i ll get to work chopping my work around until it suits your preferred format shan millie gave me some good feedback on general points of style and clarity in my writing but incorporating these would actually make the article longer rather than shorter i think you d better look the document over before i do further work on it i look forward to your response many thanks steve leppard enron capital trade resources corp from navroz patel number number number number number pm please respond to navroz patel to cc subject dear steven my name is navroz patel and i am the technical assistant at risk magazine i am contacting you with regards to your initial dialogue with nick dunbar we would be grateful if you could email to both of the addresses below a copy of your real options article for our consideration please note that articles must have full references be approximately number words in length and the attachment should be in ms word or pdf format npatel risk co uk ndunbar risk co uk thank you for your interest yours sincerely navroz patel technical assistant risk magazine	NORMAL

corrected new update on ppi model for inflation book dear all i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows number use less data unfortunately kicking out only number makes the overall equation a lot less robust in fact dramatically so and so eliminates the possibility of using less data the model tested was the rpi month number ppi pre empts the moves in rpi by about number months the magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately conclusion i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi rpi t number and deviations of brent crude from long term average the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients which results in us having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long term average of number number was the best form of the variable to use for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used the three new equations developed were pllu t a rpi t b rpi t n c datedbrentcrude number number constant where n is number number or number reddish curves r squared approx number number f stat approx number the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation and also the three best relations from before which were based upon current and future rpi pllu t a rpi t b rpi t n constant where n is number number or number greenish curves r squared approx number number f stat approx number comparison of models as you can see the two equations differ in the very short term and very long term the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short term predictions of number number to number number over the next six months the greenish curves predict pllu in the range of number number to number number over the next six months the curves are then very similar until number when the models including crude break away to the upside relative to the falling rpi curve the model based purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond number which we don t suggestion what could be useful now is a differently specified model designed to forecast only the next number months using auto regressive or auto regressive error terms this model would be far more accurate in the near term and we could include this information onto the front of this long term model this may be useful despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time buckets back testing all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used based mainly on number s new paradigm economy hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele conference your ideas on this would be appreciated regards anjam x number	NORMAL

the storage revolution has begun network world fusion focus amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today s focus the storage revolution has begun number number number dear wincenty kaminski today s focus the storage revolution has begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype we are in the middle of a storage revolution virtually overnight businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery it isn  t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements businesses demand fault tolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees suppliers and customers but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements on average double every number months while processor speeds double every number months companies are left with a quandary how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds the simple answer to this question is to institute a well executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems there are several ways to efficiently manage storage one of the best routes is consolidation that is pooling resources and managing storage as a system as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era when enterprise storage resided on mainframes but it  s actually a progressive step as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning management and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files next it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization consequently storage requirements vary by business application as in all areas of it it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth intensive backup and recovery operations from the lan network attached storage nas supplies it professionals with one answer giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data nas devices which have been widely available for years are optimized to process i o transactions though they promise better performance they don  t remove backups from the transport network instead they supply a relatively easy to deploy solution to cross platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments many consider storage area networks san to be the best long term answer to current and future storage challenges because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models yet given the early deployment stage most companies are still in many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment this newsletter will examine how through effective storage management it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library instead it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues ultimately the goal is

energy leader consulting generation evaluator ege shirley as requested herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski the presentation on the ege tool s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday may number might i request it be set for late afternoon as my other appointments are the next day and as vince will recall i was co leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly and developer of the ramp up real time number check and electric strategy tools presently i am ceo of energy leader consulting elc background the u s power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively utilities who still control most power plants endeavor to adopt the entrants methods yet inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling many utilities notwithstanding the industry wide trend towards profit maximization cling to ingrained routines inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale a utility may operate a relatively small system fewer than a dozen plants a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers playing the wholesale market at the margin for a variety of reasons utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units let alone shut down any even temporarily or seasonally economically inefficient units continue to be committed week after week and run in the half load range ege objectives ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines taking into account transmission and reliability factors the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant i an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long term wholesale power transaction with a utility or to price wholesale power more aggressively to take market share from the utility i e compel changes in unit commitment habits ii an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition iii a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized specific ege concepts ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities it produces indicative statistics such as a the frequency distribution of starts per week b the frequency distribution of starts by day number minute segment during the week c the frequency distribution of load level d the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start e average heat rate and approximate fully allocated cost in the half load range f average ramp rate from the half load range g the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours and h forced off maintenance outage rate where indicated indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month year in some cases by temperature range they can be by regional wholesale prices as well ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data ege is now updated for the number th quarter number through december number number ege lst quarter number through march number number will be available approximately june number number ege also compares and ranks generating units commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility as well as other regional generators some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half load level for lengthy time periods without an apparent reliability basis splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units other ege supporting data i planned maintenance schedule where indicated j actual maximum generating capacity k actual minimum generating capacity actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government reported values l average heat rate in the full load range and m average heat rate in the three quarter load range with respect to a generating units average heat rate in the half load three quarter load and full load ranges it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities and changes in recent years in these parameters the real world example of allegheny energy allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege in the number th quarter number for instance one high cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning number times and committed for the whole day in all but two cases arguably there are power products that could substitute for this routine in part at least at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy another high cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn nine times and committed for most of the coming week at another plant two high cost units were operated too often in the expensive half load range some number hours and three quarter load range another number to number hours they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels again there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy offering of energy leader consulting elc ege is a procedure not a software package or data base elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities elc transfers its knowledge about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight forward four step process number enron would select one to three target utilities number elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities number employing this real world analysis as a pedagogic tool elc in a one day seminar with enron personnel would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future without the assistance of elc number optionally elc would provide ege supporting data quarterly to enron the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program virtually all fossil fuel units parameters that are incorporated and the data set format will be specified upon

urgent response dear sir madam you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don t know me personally i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr john da costa who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority before his death he deposited the sum of us number number million fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the modus operandi adopted by the government this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs precisely more than fifty one number people have so far been killed heads of governments from the west especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe s plan subsequently south african development community s a d c has continuously supported mugabe s new land act it is against this background that i and my family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband s money into a foreign account as a family i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth and south africa s government seems to be playing along with them i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history more so the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an asylum as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands i must let you know that this transaction is number risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter for your assistance i will offering you number of the total sum number for my family while number will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction i wish to invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice finally all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company s account in your country if this proposal is acceptable by you please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number number or e mail address mariadacosta number yahoo com best regards mrs maria da costa for the family	SPAM

i on behalf of my colleagues from the federal government of nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of us number twentyone million five hundred thousand us dollars into your bank account these funds emanated from unclaimed contractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not meet their financial obligations to their creditors we as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatals were mandated by the federal government to scrutinize all payments made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered that some of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement which collectively left the sum of us number thirtyfive million five hundred thousand us dollars lying in a suspended account however from our investigations we discovered that the foreign beneficiary companies have since been liquidated and to all intents and purposes no longer exist in nigeria thus providing us with this opportunity provided that we have a capable partner to execute a transaction of this nature we agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas bank account to be provided by a reliable foreign firmassociate this is because as serving government workers the civil service code does not allow us to operate foreign account in our initial attempt to do this we succeeded in transferring part of this amount us number m fourteen million dollars into a united states dollar account in beirut lebanon but our foreign associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead that the total amount be transferred into the account before we can share the money as a result we have lost confidence in the ability of our lebanese partner to see this matter to its logical conclusion and until the initial transaction is satisfactorily resolved we have cancelled further transactions with him in the light of the foregoing it is clear that we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistance and cooperation in executing this matter but will honour the terms of agreement when we reach the concluding stages of this transaction we therefore offer the amount of number of the entire sum in return for servicesassistance rendered in successfully carrying out this project we trust that you appreciate the sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution on our part but when a relationship is confidently established and operations commence you will be provided with all relevant information i remain at your disposal to entertain any questionsenquiries relating to this proposition and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e mail for further information on the procedures and requirements of this transaction in your reply remember to indicate a safe telephone number where i can always reach you hope to hear from you soon please treat with the strictest confidentiality and expediency	FRAUD
